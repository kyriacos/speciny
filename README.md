#Speciny

A tiny RSpec clone.

NOT a replacement for RSpec, NOR is it trying to be the new
cool kid on the block.

RSpec is awesome and you should use that.

For those tiny projects, you may have and want to try something new then do so :).

However there's MiniTest Spec which ships with Ruby 1.9.

As such use this project and learn how Ruby and DSL/Testing Frameworks work.

I got some of the ideas for the self-test specs from:
https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-8/docs/hooks/before-and-after-hooks

### Using

Just clone the repo `require 'lib/speciny'` and you're off.

Run your specs using:
```
bin/speciny spec/your_spec.rb
```

Just typing in `bin/speciny` will run any tests in your spec directory.

### Help out
If you have any ideas, fixes, any refactoring, please do send it in. I'm
learning ruby so any suggestions are welcome.

Thanks
