Speciny
-------
This is meant to be a tiny RSpec clone.

Not a replacement for RSpec, nor is it trying to be the new
cool kid on the block.

RSpec is awesome and you should use that. For those tiny projects,
you may choose to use this. However there's minitest which ships with
Ruby 1.9 and has a Spec class as well which you can use.

As such use this project and learn how Ruby and Testing Frameworks work.

A lot of the ideas for the spec i got from:
