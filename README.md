#Speciny

A tiny RSpec clone.

NOT a replacement for RSpec, NOR is it trying to be the new
cool kid on the block.

RSpec is awesome and you should use that.
For those tiny projects, you may have and want to try something new then do so :).

Then again there's MiniTest Spec which ships with Ruby 1.9.

I am learning ruby and wanted to understand how RSpec and DSLs work so i decided to write a tiny clone.
Truth be told i got the idea from [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/building-rspec-from-scratch)
which i highly recommend.


Some of the ideas for the test specs i got from:
<https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-8/docs/hooks/before-and-after-hooks>

### Documentation
Check out the (github pages)[http://kyriacos.github.com/speciny].

### Using

Just clone the repo `require 'lib/speciny'` and you're off.

Run your specs using:
```
bin/speciny spec/your_spec.rb
```

Just typing in `bin/speciny` will run any tests in your spec directory.

### Help out
If you have any ideas, fixes, any refactoring, please do send it in. I'm
learning ruby so any suggestions are welcome.

Thanks!
